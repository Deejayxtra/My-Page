                    I'm Ayodeji Olumuyiwa, a seasoned software tester with over 3 years of hands-on experience. My journey in testing has
                    taken me across diverse platforms and environments, where I've honed my skills in both manual and automation testing. As
                    an aspiring software developer, I'm excited to embark on a new chapter in my career, delving into the world of software
                    development. Passionate about creating efficient and reliable software solutions, I look forward to the challenges and
                    learning opportunities that lie ahead.
